# TheBrain MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables AI assistants to interact with TheBrain's knowledge management system. This server provides comprehensive access to TheBrain's API, focusing on natural language interaction with TheBrain's powerful knowledge management capabilities.

## 🔧 What's an MCP Server?

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a standard that lets AI assistants like Claude connect to external tools and services. Think of it as a translator between natural language and software APIs.

### How It Works:
```
You → Claude → MCP Server → TheBrain API → Your Brain
```

1. **You say**: "Create a project with three phases"
2. **Claude understands** what you want to accomplish  
3. **MCP Server translates** this into specific TheBrain API calls
4. **TheBrain API** creates the thoughts and connections
5. **Your Brain** updates with the new structure

The magic is that **you don't need to know any technical details** - just describe what you want in plain English!

## 🚀 What Actually Works

### ✅ **Core Functionality (Working)**
- **Content Management**: Create, update, delete thoughts and notes
- **File Attachments**: Upload images, PDFs, documents to thoughts
- **Web References**: URL attachments with auto-title extraction  
- **Rich Notes**: Full Markdown support with embedded content
- **Relationship Mapping**: Connect thoughts with meaningful relationships
- **Search**: Full-text search across thoughts, notes, and attachments
- **Brain Management**: Switch between multiple brains seamlessly
- **Natural Language Interface**: Describe what you want, Claude handles the details

## ❌ Current Issues & Limitations

### 🚨 **Major Visual Styling Problems**
**The biggest limitation**: Visual properties don't actually apply despite API success responses.

- **❌ Thought colors**: API accepts colors but they don't appear in TheBrain
- **❌ Link colors**: Similar issue - accepted but not applied  
- **❌ Link thickness**: API reports success but thickness doesn't change
- **❌ Visual formatting**: All visual styling features are currently non-functional

### 🐛 **Other Known Issues**
- **Intermittent connection problems**: "Field required" errors after successful operations
- **Long notes limitations**: Issues with very long markdown content (keep under 10k characters)
- **File path sensitivity**: Requires absolute file paths; relative paths can fail
- **Connection timing**: MCP initialization race condition causing sporadic failures
- **Memory constraints**: Large file attachments can cause timeouts
- **Search limitations**: Complex queries sometimes return incomplete results

### 📋 **API Dependencies & Constraints**
- **Single-user operations**: No real-time collaboration features
- **No bulk operations**: Can't import/export large datasets efficiently  
- **API connectivity required**: No offline mode available
- **TheBrain API limitations**: Bound by existing API capabilities
- **Authentication required**: Must have valid TheBrain API key

## 🛠 **Current Workarounds**

Until visual styling is fixed, use these alternatives:
- **Emojis for distinction**: 🟢🟡🔴⚪🔵 instead of colors
- **Descriptive names**: "🔴 Urgent Task" instead of colored thoughts
- **Rich markdown notes**: Use formatting within notes for visual organization
- **Hierarchical structure**: Rely on parent/child relationships for organization

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MattGyverLee/thebrain-mcp.git
cd thebrain-mcp
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file with your API key:
```bash
THEBRAIN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
THEBRAIN_DEFAULT_BRAIN_ID=optional_default_brain_id
```

## Configuration

### For Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "thebrain": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/thebrain-mcp/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "THEBRAIN_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**⚠️ Important**: Use absolute file paths in the configuration and for file attachments.

## Debugging & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**"Field required" errors**:
- Restart Claude Desktop
- Verify `.env` file has correct API key
- Always set active brain first: "Set my active brain to [name]"

**File upload failures**:
- Use absolute file paths: `/Users/username/Documents/file.pdf`
- Check file permissions and existence
- Keep file sizes reasonable (< 50MB)

**Long note problems**:
- Keep notes under 10,000 characters
- Break large content into multiple thoughts
- Use attachments for lengthy documents

**Debug mode**:
```bash
VERBOSE=true node index.js
```
